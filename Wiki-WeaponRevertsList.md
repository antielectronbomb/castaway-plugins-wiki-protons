## Item Sets Reverts List

**_Note: All reverted Item Sets DO NOT REQUIRE their corresponding cosmetic hats, because hat crafting is locked behind a paywall for F2P players. Players only need to equip the set weapons._**

**_Note for server owners: Take into mind that if you revert the item sets, some weapons will stack with the set bonus (e.g. modern Powerjack's +15% speed on active stacks with the set's +10% passive speed). It is advised to use the config file `exec reverts_enable_itemsets.cfg` to preserve historical accuracy and old balancing._**
