	- No longer ignores general damage resistances from e.g. Battalion's Backup and Spy's cloak.
	- Bullet and ranged resistances are still ignored.

### July 6, 2025
- **Reverted Righteous Bison and Pomson 6000 now ignores damage resistances for historical accuracy.**
	- Both weapons used to have the "Untyped" damage type before Tough Break. Weapons with the Untyped damage type are not considered bullet/fire/explosive/melee damage.
	- An example of a vanilla weapon with Untyped damage is the Flying Guillotine on its first hit. Bleed damage is also an example of Untyped damage.
	- This means that the Bison and Pomson can now pierce through Vaccinator bullet resistance. Previously, both weapons had the Bullet damage type. Now, it should act like Untyped damage type.
		- Technically, both weapons still use "Bullet" damage types since the piercing attribute that ignores resistances is used instead. The piercing attribute mostly mimics the mechanics of Untyped damage.
- **Added Polish language support**

           - https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/index.php?title=Equalizer&oldid=1048826

           - This and the pre-Hatless Update versions of the Equalizer (and with random damage spread on by default back then) are what got stuck inside the collective consciousness of the TF2 community, and it didn't help _that certain popular figures who never experienced them and did not do enough research_ just regurgitated the old memories of these versions of the Equalizer. Remember to not trust anyone, and always do your own research.

    - 20% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer
    - No afterburn immunity

### May 20, 2025

- **Added a cvar for reverting the fall damage hurt sound to pre-Jungle Inferno (cvar_old_falldmg_sfx).**
  - By default, this cvar revert is enabled.

### May 18, 2025
- **Fixed reverted B.A.S.E. Jumper fire updraft bonus not working**

### May 15, 2025
- **Reverted the shield charge mechanics and stats for the Splendid Screen to pre-Tough Break.**
  - Right after impacting an enemy with a shield charge, the Demoman is able to do a critical melee hit from any distance, even at close range.
    - See this video for a clearer example (start at 3:55): https://youtu.be/DByy2z7VLzI?si=DZAkfYb3b24rkBAv&t=235
  - The reverted Splendid Screen can still do shield bash damage at any distance, but it does not have the +50% charge recharge rate bonus anymore and only has +15% explosive damage resistance on wearer compared to the current vanilla version.
  - Charging with The Splendid Screen does not remove debuffs anymore (Afterburn, Jarate, Mad Milk, Bleed & Gas) from the wearer.
    - *The Splendid Screen*
    - *+20% fire damage resistance on wearer*
    - *+15% explosive damage resistance on wearer*

### May 11, 2025
- **Reverted the shield charge mechanics for the Chargin' Targe and the Tide Turner.**
  - Right after impacting an enemy with a shield charge, the Demoman is able to do a critical melee hit from any distance, even at close range.
    - See this video for a clearer example (start at 3:55): https://youtu.be/DByy2z7VLzI?si=DZAkfYb3b24rkBAv&t=235
  - However, both the Chargin' Targe and the Tide Turner are not able to deal shield bash damage at any distance and must be at the end of the charge to deal shield bash damage.
  - Charging with The Chargin' Targe and the Tide Turner does not remove debuffs anymore (Afterburn, Jarate, Mad Milk, Bleed & Gas) from the wearer.
    - *The Chargin' Targe and The Tide Turner*
    - *Alt-Fire: Charge toward your enemies.*
    - *Gain a critical melee strike after impacting an enemy.*

### May 9, 2025
- **Fixed the Big Earner's 3-second speedboost being extended by the reverted Dead Ringer on feign death.**
- **Fixed the duration reduction of Spies under Dead Ringer when being damaged by weapons such as the Ullapool Caber and the Enforcer.**
- **Made the damage resistance attribute of the reverted Brass Beast (and the Natascha) to be more historically accurate.**
  - The damage resistance percentage now depends on what type of damage is dealt onto the Heavy. For normal damage, 20% damage resistance is applied. For mini-crit damage received, 14.7% damage resistance is applied. For critical hit damage received, 6.7% damage resistance is applied.
- **Damage resistance sounds now play when the Heavy is hit while spinning up the reverted Brass Beast and the reverted Natascha.**
- **Reverted Natascha to pre-Meet your Match. The 20% damage resistance when spun up now applies regardless of current HP.**
  - *The Natascha*
    - On Hit: 100% chance to slow target
    - 20% damage resistance when spun up
    - -25% damage penalty
    - 30% slower spin up time

### May 1, 2025
- **Updated reverts.txt offsets in the gamedata folder, fixing the Soldier's rocket kills showing up as headshots, the reverted Short Circuit's alt-fire using the modern energy ball, and the Thermal Thruster playing a parachute sound on use.**
  - For context, TF2 had a recent patch which affected the weapon reverts plug-in.
- **Updated the reverted Crit-a-Cola's damage vulnerability attribute to be more historically accurate.**
  - The 10% damage vulnerability should only apply to normal damage. Mini-crit and critical hit damage does not get modified by the 10% damage vulnerability attribute. This means Scouts don't die faster to mini-crits and critical hits now.
- **Fixed the reverted Black Box's heal-on-hit attribute to work again.**

### April 28, 2025
- **Added Windows port for the weapon reverts plugin. The plugin should now work out of the box for Windows servers.**

     - +25% explosive damage resistance on wearer
     - Full turning control while charging
     - Melee kills refill 75% of your charge meter
     - Taking damage while shield charging reduces remaining charging time
- **The reverted Soda Popper's visuals have been updated to be more historically accurate to its release version. When the Hype meter is full, the glow now shows up as a Mini-Crits glow instead of a purple glow.**
  - The purple glow will only appear if the Scout equips the Crit-a-Cola or the Bonk! Atomic Punch due to how the game technically handles Mini-Crit conditions.

### April 23, 2025
- **Crit-a-Cola no longer marks the user for death for a few frames anymore.**

### April 21, 2025
- **The Dead Ringer is now reverted to its most accurate state before Gun Mettle. 90% damage resistance for up to 6.5 seconds that gets reduced by damage received. This Dead Ringer is now able to tank 5 backstabs and 8 stickybombs from 125 HP, and 14 stickybombs when using the Kunai at 200 HP. The previous version of the revert would only tank 1 backstab and up to 4 to 5 stickybombs.**
- **Fixed reverted Powerjack bug where the Pyro gets healed when an enemy dies to afterburn while the Powerjack is the active weapon. It should only heal due to melee kills by the Powerjack.**

### April 17, 2025
- **Fixed reverted Black Box overheal bug where hitting an enemy removes the Soldier's overheal.**
- **Ball recharge time for the reverted Sandman is now 15 seconds long for historical accuracy (pre-Jungle Inferno).**

### December 29, 2024
- **Reverted Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol to release**

    - +15 max health on wearer

    - -50% clip size (2 pipes in clip)
    - +25% damage to self
    - Launched bombs shatter on surfaces
  - **Note: when this was implemented, the grenade tumbling attribute was not included, so this reverted version was historically inaccurate.**
    - Historically, the grenade tumbling attribute in the pre-Smissmas 2014 Loch-n-Load was not only a visual difference, but also slowed down the old Loch-n-Load's projectile speed.
      - See video for a demonstration of the grenade tumbling attribute affecting projectile speed: https://youtu.be/ACfafLuLmy8?t=143
      - This is caused by the Source physics engine including air resistance with projectiles.
